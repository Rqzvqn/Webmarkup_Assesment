                <h3>Solar panels</h3>
                <p>The term solar panel is used colloquially for a photo-voltaic (PV) module.

                    A PV module is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells mounted in a framework for installation.
                    Photo-voltaic
                    cells use sunlight as a source of energy and generate direct current electricity. A collection of PV
                    modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a photovoltaic system
                    supply
                    solar electricity to electrical equipment.

                    The most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is solar water heating
                    systems.

                <h3>Charge controller</h3>
                <p>A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current
                    is
                    added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against
                    overvoltage,
                    which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent
                    completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on
                    the
                    battery technology, to protect battery life. The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may
                    refer to either a stand-alone device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack,
                    battery-powered device, or battery charger.</p>

                <h3>Battery system</h3>
                <p>A battery management system (BMS) is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery (cell
                    or
                    battery pack), such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating
                    area[clarification needed], monitoring its state, calculating secondary data, reporting that data,
                    controlling its environment, authenticating it and / or balancing it. A battery pack built together
                    with
                    a battery management system with an external communication data bus is a smart battery pack. A smart
                    battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger.</p>

                <h3>DC power</h3>
                <p>Direct current (DC) is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An
                    electrochemical
                    cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but
                    can
                    also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams.
                    The
                    electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A
                    term
                    formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.</p>

            <article class="child5">
                <h3>Inverter</h3>
                <p>A power inverter, or inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current
                    (DC)
                    to alternating current (AC). The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power
                    handling
                    depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power;
                    the
                    power is provided by the DC source. A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a
                    combination
                    of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not
                    use
                    moving parts in the conversion process.</p>

                <h3>AC power</h3>
                <p>Instantaneous power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the
                    circuit. In alternating current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors
                    may
                    result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow. The portion of power that, averaged
                    over a
                    complete cycle of the AC waveform, results in net transfer of energy in one direction is known as
                    active
                    power The portion of power due to stored energy, which returns to the source in each cycle, is known
                    as
                    instantaneous reactive power, and its amplitude is the absolute value of reactive power.</p>
